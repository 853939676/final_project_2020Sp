# Corona Beer and COVID-19
This is Rui Liu(ruiliu8)'s final project for IS590PR Spring2020.

Project Type: (Type II Projects) Specifics for an Original Data Analysis

## Proposal: 

**Description:**

The spread of COVID-19 is causing huge panic around the world. Due to the name of coronavirus, 
some people connect it with Corona Beer and refuse to buy any Corona Beer under this circumstances. This project aims to study how the spread of COVID-19 influence the stock price of Constellation Brand(owner of Corona Beer). 

**Hypothesis:**

* The spread of COVID-19 will negatively influence the stock price of Constellation.
* The influence of coronavirus on STZ stock price will gradually disappear as coronavirus continues.

**Datasets:**

* COVID-19 Data: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
* Stock price data: csv files downloaded from https://finance.yahoo.com/

## Methodology
The program can retrieve up-to-date stock prices and COVID-19 data online and merge them together 
to visualize stock prices and the spread of COVID-19.

Users can run the code directly to get following comparisons:
* Stock prices of Corona vs. Bud Light before and after COVID-19
* Stock prices of Corona vs. Coors Light before and after COVID-19
* Stock price differences and new confirmed cases in the US

Additional analysis can also be done using this program by changing function parameters, 
some examples are given in the code:
* Compare stock price difference of Corona Beer and S&P 500 number.
* Compare stock price difference with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Illinois state.

A slide containing detailed code structures and result graphs can be downloaded [here.](https://github.com/853939676/final_project_2020Sp/blob/master/Slide.pdf)

## Result:

* The spread of COVID-19 did negatively impacted the stock price of Corona Beer compared with other beer companies, 
especially from 3/06 to 3/18.
* The effect of COVID-19 is decreasing after 3/18.

* There might be a positive relationship between COVID-19 and the stock price of Corona Beer compared with S&P 500 number.
